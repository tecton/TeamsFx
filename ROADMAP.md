## Teams Toolkit Roadmap

Our roadmap and priorities are shaped by your feedback, issues, discussions, surveys, social media, and market opportunities. We want to make building apps for Teams fast, simple, and delightful. We're constantly learning, and we listen to your feedback and adapt our plans if needed. The items below may not include everything we have planned. If you have feedback or suggestions, create a new GitHub issue, or react with a üëç on an existing issue.

Based on your feedback, we plan to focus on the following themes in 2022:

**Microsoft 365 Platform:** We‚Äôre committed to providing Day 1 support for new Microsoft 365 capabilities and features.

**Support for familiar language & tools:** Teams Toolkit works with the languages, frameworks, tools, and services you know and love.

**Get started fast:** Teams Toolkit is the simplest way to get started building for Microsoft 365 with delightful tooling, samples, and documentation.

**Development velocity:** best-in-class productivity to create, build, and deliver your apps.

**Ship with confidence:** Teams Toolkit is enterprise-ready to help developers and IT administrators deliver, manage, and monitor apps with confidence.

#### Q3-Q4 2022

##### Teams Toolkit General Availability
We‚Äôre planning to make Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio generally available later this year in Visual Studio 2022.

##### Free, secure, integrated network tunneling
We know how challenging it can be to debug different capabilities and services with your Teams apps and that it‚Äôs not always possible to use existing options for network tunneling in your enterprise environments. To help with this, Teams Toolkit will use new tooling that provides a network tunnel that allows secure communication only from Microsoft Teams.

##### Mobile preview
Teams Toolkit will continue to make running your apps simple including on mobile devices. We‚Äôre bringing support for launching to Teams and Outlook mobile first, and Office mobile will follow later this year.  

##### Office add-ins
We‚Äôre collaborating with the Office add-ins team to make it simpler to create add-ins with a single set of tools using Teams Toolkit. This will bring the same quick getting started and simple run and debug experience we‚Äôve made for Teams to Office add-ins. 

##### Yeoman generator support
One of our themes this year is to support familiar tooling, and to continue this theme we‚Äôll make it simpler to work with the popular tooling that you‚Äôre using to create apps for M365. Based on your feedback, we‚Äôre starting with the Yeoman generators for Microsoft Teams Apps and the SharePoint Framework so that these projects can easily use Teams Toolkit to run and debug their apps. 

##### Deployment
We‚Äôve heard your feedback on the need for more flexible provisioning and deployment configurations. We‚Äôll make it simpler to integrate with your enterprises‚Äô existing cloud deployment process.

##### App scenarios
Teams Toolkit is a terrific way to get started with Teams app development and we want to continue this theme and help solve common business problems with scenario-focused solutions. We‚Äôre starting with a few templates that help jumpstart your bot apps. We‚Äôll add support for additional scenarios based on your feedback.
