## How to scaffold from pre-release templates?

Teams Toolkit downloads latest stable templates by default from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/releases) for scaffolding.

To scaffold your project from rc templates, set the environment varaible `TEAMSFX_TEMPLATE_PRERELEASE=rc`. Then Teams Toolkit download templates from [rc release](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/releases/tag/templates%400.0.0-rc)

To scaffold from alpha release templates, set `TEAMSFX_TEMPLATE_PRERELEASE=alpha`. Then Teams Toolkit download templates from [rc release](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/releases/tag/templates%400.0.0-alpha)

## How to release a new template?

1. Add the relative path to your new template in [package.json](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/dev/templates/package.json)
  ```
  "templates": [
        "blazor-base/csharp/default",
        "bot/csharp/default",
        "bot/js/default",
        "bot/ts/default",
        "your/new/template"
  ]
  ```
2. In cd pipeline, all templates in the list will be zipped and be released to GitHub.

3. If your new template can not be scaffolded by older version Teams Toolkit, you need to commit your changes with a `BREAKING CHANGE` footer. The body of the footer has to be multi-line and the footer line must start with `BREAKING CHANGE:`
```
$ git add .

$ git commit -m "feat(tab): upgrade react-scirpts
BREAKING CHANGE: drop support for Node 12"

$ git push
```

Some breaking change cases:

* Involve new placeholder in templates.
* Upgrade template's dependencies which deprecates support to lower version NodeJs. Latest Teams Toolkit notices users to upgrade their environment but older version Teams Toolkit does not.
* Remove or rename templates.

Cases that are not breaking changes:

* Add new templates that old Teams Toolkit does not have entry to get and scaffold them.
* Add new features to templates that does not require any change in Teams Toolkit.
* Totally rewrite a template but old Teams Toolkit can still work with it.

## How to debug templates?

1. Set `TEAMSFX_DEBUG_TEMPLATE=true` to your environment variables.
2. If you would like to debug csharp scaffolding template through VS Teams Toolkit Extension, please also set `NODE_ENV="development"` to your environment variables.
3. Add your changes in templates source code.
4. cd to vscode-extension folder.
5. F5 to local debug and create new project.
6. The `FetchTemplateZipFromSourceCode` action will get template from the source code that you just changed.

* `FetchTemplatesUrlWithTag`, `FetchTemplatesZipFromUrl`, `FetchTemplateZipFromLocal`, these actions are skipped.
